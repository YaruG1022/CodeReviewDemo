          # ❌ Unit Tests Failed

          The unit tests for this PR are failing. Before we can review the code quality, you need to make the tests pass.

          Please uncomment the necessary code to fix the functionality issues, then we'll review the code for best practices.

          Common issues that might cause test failures:
          - Missing null checks
          - Missing input validation
          - Exception handling is incomplete
